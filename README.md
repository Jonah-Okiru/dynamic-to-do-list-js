# Advanced Application of JavaScript (To-Do List).

## Project Overview.
This project is designed to enhance understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts by building a dynamic To-Do List application. You'll learn how to manipulate DOM elements, handle user interactions, and utilize local storage to persist data.

## Project Goals.
### Dynamic DOM Manipulation 
- Effectively select and modify DOM elements to create a responsive user interface.
### Event Handling.
- Implement event listeners to handle user interactions, such as adding and removing tasks.
### Local Storage.
- Utilize local storage to save and retrieve task data, ensuring persistence across browser sessions.

## Project Structure.
### index.html.
- The main HTML file containing the structure of the To-Do List application.
### styles.css.
- The CSS file responsible for styling the application's appearance. Â  
### script.js.
- The JavaScript file containing the logic for adding, removing, and displaying tasks, as well as interacting with local storage.

## Project Setup.
1.Clone this repository or create a new project directory.
2.Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3.Ensure you have a web browser installed to test the application.

## Getting Started.
1.Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2.You should see a basic To-Do List interface with an input field for entering tasks and a button to add them.
3.Start adding tasks and observe how they are displayed and removed.

## Project Submission.
Once you have completed the project, submit your code repository on the specified platform. Ensure the following:
### Functionality.
- Your To-Do List application should correctly add, remove, and display tasks.
### Local Storage.
- Task data should be persisted using local storage, allowing tasks to be retained across browser sessions.
### Code Quality.
- Your code should be well-structured, commented, and follow best practices.
### Testing.
- Thoroughly test your application to ensure it works as expected.
